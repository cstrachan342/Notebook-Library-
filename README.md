# Notebook-Library-
Collection of notebooks containing written up projects documenting workflows for building successful machine learning models.

I intend to use this as a place to share all my work where a separate github repository is not necessary.

Throughout my journey of learning machine learning I have read countless notebooks shared by other enthuiasts, which was pivitol to my learning of the subject matter. This is a major inspriration for the creation of this repository, as I hope that one day some of my work can contribute to the learning of an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer too. Some of the work here is outdated and not created using optimal workflows and not how I would approach a task/project now. I am still happy to share this and it shows the evolution in my journey.
